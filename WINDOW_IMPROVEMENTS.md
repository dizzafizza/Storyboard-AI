# Window System Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the window system in Storyboard AI to fix positioning issues and improve scaling throughout the application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Windows Opening Inside Parent Windows
**Problem**: Sub-windows (like AI Image Settings, Agent Selector, Chat History) were opening inside the AI Assistant window instead of at the root level.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented React portals in `WindowFrame.tsx` to render all windows at the document body level
- Moved sub-window components outside of parent `WindowFrame` containers in `AIAssistant.tsx`
- Added `usePortal` prop (default: true) to control portal behavior

### 2. Z-Index Stacking Issues
**Problem**: Windows were not properly stacking, causing sub-windows to appear behind parent windows.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive z-index hierarchy in `index.css`
- Implemented `WindowManager` utility for dynamic z-index management
- Added click-to-front functionality

### 3. Poor Scaling and Positioning
**Problem**: Windows didn't scale properly on different screen sizes and had positioning issues.

**Solution**:
- Created `ResponsiveScaling` utility with adaptive font sizes, line heights, and padding
- Improved window positioning with better viewport constraints
- Added CSS containment properties for better performance
- Enhanced mobile responsiveness

## Key Improvements Made

1. **React Portals**: All windows now render at document.body level to prevent stacking context issues
2. **Dynamic Z-Index Management**: WindowManager utility handles proper window layering
3. **Responsive Scaling**: Adaptive sizing based on window dimensions
4. **Better Positioning**: Improved viewport constraints and cascade positioning
5. **Enhanced Performance**: CSS containment and optimized rendering
6. **Mobile Optimization**: Better touch handling and responsive design

## Files Modified

- `src/components/WindowFrame.tsx` - Added portal support and window management
- `src/components/AIAssistant.tsx` - Moved sub-windows outside main container
- `src/components/AIImageSettings.tsx` - Updated z-index
- `src/components/AIAgentSelector.tsx` - Updated z-index  
- `src/components/ChatHistoryManager.tsx` - Updated z-index
- `src/index.css` - Enhanced window styling and z-index hierarchy
- `src/utils/windowManager.ts` - New utility for window management

## Testing

To verify the fixes:
1. Open AI Assistant
2. Click settings/agent selector buttons
3. Verify sub-windows appear above main window
4. Test window resizing and scaling
5. Test on different screen sizes
