# Legacy Cursor Rules - Migrated to .cursor/rules/

**⚠️ This file is deprecated.** The rules have been migrated to the new MDC format in `.cursor/rules/`:

- **`.cursor/rules/conport-development.mdc`** - Main ConPort-first development rules
- **`.cursor/rules/react-patterns.mdc`** - React and TypeScript specific patterns  
- **`.cursor/rules/ai-integration.mdc`** - AI service integration patterns
- **`.cursor/rules/documentation.mdc`** - Documentation and knowledge management

The new format provides:
- ✅ Context-aware rule activation (only when relevant)
- ✅ Better token efficiency for AI interactions
- ✅ Automatic file pattern matching
- ✅ Improved team collaboration through version control

**To complete migration:**
1. Restart Cursor IDE to load the new MDC rules
2. Verify rules are working in Cursor Settings > Rules
3. Delete this file once migration is confirmed
