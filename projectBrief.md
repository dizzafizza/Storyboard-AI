# Storyboard AI - Project Brief

## Project Overview

Storyboard AI is a comprehensive React TypeScript application designed for creating, managing, and generating AI-powered video storyboards. The application combines traditional storyboard creation workflows with advanced AI assistance to streamline the creative process for filmmakers, content creators, and video production teams.

## Core Purpose

The primary goal is to bridge the gap between creative vision and technical execution by providing:
- Intuitive storyboard panel creation and management

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and responsive design
- **Context API** for state management (StoryboardContext, ThemeContext)

### AI Service Integration
- **OpenAI GPT-4** integration for conversational AI assistance
- **Custom AI Agents** with specialized capabilities for different creative tasks
- **Prompt Engineering** with sophisticated context assembly and optimization
- **Local Processing** where possible to maintain privacy and reduce API costs

### Data & Storage Architecture
- **Local Storage** for user preferences and settings
- **File-based** project storage with JSON serialization
- **Privacy-first** approach with no cloud dependency requirements
- **Export/Import** capabilities for project sharing and backup

### Context Management System
- **ConPort Integration** for structured knowledge management
- **Vector Embeddings** for semantic search across project knowledge
- **Knowledge Graph** construction for component and concept relationships
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** for enhanced AI assistance

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **Independent Filmmakers** creating detailed pre-production storyboards
- **Content Creators** planning video content for social media and marketing
- **Video Production Teams** collaborating on commercial and creative projects
- **Film Students** learning storyboarding techniques and best practices

### Use Cases
- **Pre-Production Planning** - Detailed shot planning and visual communication
- **Client Presentations** - Professional storyboard presentation and approval
- **Creative Collaboration** - Team coordination and creative decision documentation
- **Educational Projects** - Teaching and learning visual storytelling techniques

## Key Technologies & Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- React 18.x with TypeScript 5.x
- Vite 5.x for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS 3.x for styling
- OpenAI API for AI integration

### Development Tools
- **ConPort MCP Server** for context management and knowledge graphs
- **ChromaDB** for vector embeddings and semantic search
- **SQLite** for structured project knowledge storage
- **Python 3.8+** for ConPort server runtime

## Architectural Principles

### Privacy & Security
- **Local-first** data storage with user control over information
- **API Key Security** with proper key management and rotation
- **No Telemetry** - user activity remains private
- **Encryption** for sensitive project data at rest

### Performance & Scalability
- **Component Optimization** with React.memo and proper re-render management
- **Large File Handling** with lazy loading and memory management
- **Efficient AI Integration** with request batching and caching
- **Bundle Optimization** with code splitting and tree shaking

### Developer Experience
- **Type Safety** with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- **Pattern Consistency** with established design patterns and conventions
- **Documentation-First** approach with comprehensive guides and examples
- **ConPort Integration** for structured knowledge management and context assembly

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- Intuitive storyboard creation workflow with minimal learning curve
- Responsive AI assistance that enhances rather than replaces creativity
- Reliable project management with auto-save and version control
- Professional-quality output suitable for client presentations

### Technical Performance
- Fast application startup and responsive UI interactions
